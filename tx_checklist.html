            <ul class="ph">If the borrower is using insurance or FEMA funds, we deduct those funds from the real estate eligibility. Repairs to real estate is not an issue as long as the borrower does not exceed the dollar amount received from insurance or FEMA. The borrower must be advised to stop repairs if they are going to exceed these funds.</ul>
            <ul class="ph"> If the borrower is using their own funds or exceeding the insurance or FEMA funds, started the repairs prior to notification and ceased upon notification, the LO will not deduct the amount already spent. The loan will be approved for full eligibility , and Legal will secure a reduced amount. The remainder will be unsecured or secured by other collateral.</ul>
            <ul class="ph"> If repairs started after (or continued after) notification, then the loan eligibility will be reduced by the amount spent on repairs or owed to the contractor.</ul>
            <ul><button class=bFont>The collateral documents will need to be completed at an SBA DRC, an attorney’s office, or a title company prior to commencement of repairs or delivery of materials. Your contractor must accompany you to sign the documents.</button></ul>
            <ul><button class=bFont>We cannot disburse any funds to you until the loan closing documents, including collateral documents, are executed. Your case manager will be available to guide you through the disbursement process. </button></ul>
